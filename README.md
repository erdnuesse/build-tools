build-growl
===========

Hi Folks,

here all the tools you need as of today (Sept. 26th, 2013) 
for building growl (or other projects) from the sources.
works ON MOUNTAIN LION.

I included everything, just to provide downloads, without having 
to create a developer ID.

This is a public repo, and since I don't know about security on git:

SCAN THESE FILES FOR VIRUSES.
CHECK CRC/MD5

You have been warned.
cheerio, erdnuesse
